linked list is linear data structure 
blocks idhar udhar pade rehte ha
they are connected by links by pointers
each block points some other block which then become a chain 
to reach a particular block we have to go throw multiple blocks
first node is head node which is very important 
head gaya sab gaye
we have to create the head node
singly linked list is the which point the other node but we cant reverse the process kyunki uske pass sabka address hai baaki ke pass nhi ha
we need data and a pointer 
data hold data value pointer holds the address
we need node pointer
in the node class we need 2 things data and a node ponter (Node *next)
last node points at null address
